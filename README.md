This prefab will allow you to network sync a world-fixed object for late joiners. Supports worlds up to 3000 units.

## How it works

Proximity receivers find what constraint adjustments need to be made to reach a target position, and physbone angle parameters are used to reach a target rotation. Data is sent over the network in 18 steps. Sync time depends on the FPS of the host and when a remote viewer has joined the instance, relative to the state machine networking cycle. Average times are 6 seconds to 13 seconds.

## Install guide

Merge the FX controller to your own FX controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.

"Synced Object.prefab" should go to the base of your Unity scene, which will give it base Unity scaling.

Unpack the prefab by right-clicking it and move the prefab to base of your avatar.
