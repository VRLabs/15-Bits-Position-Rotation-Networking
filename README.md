## How it works

* Contact Receivers are used to turn the position of an object into bits, and physbones are used to turn the rotation of an object into bits.
* This data is transmitted over 6-13 seconds, and when received, turned back into a position and a rotation for the object.

## Install guide

* Merge the Animator Controller ``15 Bits Position Rotation Networking FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
  * If you want to try one of the examples, you can merge one of the ``FX`` controllers under ``Resources/Examples``.
  * These are more complete versions of the System, but they require a World Constraint with the ``15 Bits Position Rotation Networking Target`` under the ``World Constraint/Container`` object.
* Merge the Expression Parameters ``15 Bits Position Rotation Networking Parameters`` to your own Expression Parameters, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``15 Bits Position Rotation Networking`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.

## How to use

* The ``15BitsPositionRotationNetworking/Control`` parameter controls whether or not the System is syncing.
* Use a World Constraint to place the ``15 Bits Position Rottation Netorking Target`` in world space, and enable the ``15BitsPositionRotationNetworking/Control`` parameter.
* After the 6-13 seconds, the ``Result`` object will be placed at the ``15 Bits Position Rotation Netorking Target`` location in world space.
* You can use the following parameters to decide when to show the object and when to constrain the object to the Result target:
  * ``15BitsPositionRotationNetworking/Finished`` will be True when a player has finished networking.
  * ``15BitsPositionRotationNetworking/Interrupted`` will be True if a player has distance hidden you during networking, and didn't finish (and the Result transform is in the wrong place).

## Additional Notes

* If a remote user has _**both**_ self-interaction *and* avatar interaction permission with your avatar blocked, the world prop will never be shown to them.
* There is an object at "15 Bits Position Rotation Networking/World/Culling". You can enable the scale constraint on this object to be unculled as soon as your avatar loads.
